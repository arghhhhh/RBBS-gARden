Dora talks to herself document: (aka Rubber ducky)

there are two possible culprits I can think of that would cause Full Player not to open
1. SortObjectPairs...lets try removing that
2. ToastUI (not sure why this would cause errors but I did recently add it)



















audioSource.time gets the current time state of the audioSource being played
audioSource.clip.length gets the length of a given audioSource

once Audio gets played, create an IEnumarator that counts time until audioSource.clip.length-audioSource.time is reached,
	but that can also yield in the event that the pause button is pressed
	- or pressing pause could stop the coroutine and pressing play could reset it
